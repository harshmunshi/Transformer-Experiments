# Word Vectors (Embeddings)

Word vectors as the name suggests, is a higher dimensional mathematical representation of the "meaning" of the word.

* A mathematical attempt to represent word meanings.
* Semantically close words will occupy nearby places in the vector space.
* NOTE: Sematical closeness does not mean the understanding of grammar. For example consider the following sentences

```
A mole of carbon.
Getting the mole tested.
```

* The word "mole" might have the same embedding, but it differs in meaning.
